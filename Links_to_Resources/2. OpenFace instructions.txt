We used OpenFace developed by the CMU MultiComp Lab to extract the Action Units for each video in the Trial Dataset
https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace

We were only able to run OpenFace on our local machines, but not using the Google Colab environment.

Therefore, we have attached instructions for using OpenFace below:

Instruction for using OpenFace (Mac Users)
1. Place the "openFace.sh" script in a directory called "fea_tool"
2. Run the "openFace.sh" script
3. It will create a directory "OpenFace" inside "fea_tool"
4. Change Directory to "fea_tool/openFace/OpenFace/build/bin"
5. Place the "runfeatureExtraction.sh" script in that directory
6. Open "runfeatureExtraction.sh" and change the variable to the filepath that contains all the videos you want to extract AUs from
7. This will create a directory "processed" inside "fea_tool/openFace/OpenFace/build/bin". The "processed" directory will contain a csv file for each video processed.
8. The entire process may take many hours and depends on the number of videos you are processing.
(For ours it took more than 12 hours)
