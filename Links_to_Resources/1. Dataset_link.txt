Two datasets were used for this project:

The Miami University Deception Detection Database
- The MU3D contains 320 videos of Black and White targets, female and male, telling truths and lies. 
- Eighty (20 Black female, 20 Black male, 20 White female, and 20 White male) targets were recorded speaking honestly and dishonestly about their social relationships.
- Each target generated four different videos (i.e., positive truth, negative truth, positive lie, negative lie), yielding 320 videos fully crossing target race, target gender, statement valence, and statement veracity. 
- This database is accompanied by an excel codebook which includes data pertinent to the videos and targets included in the database.
